We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes."}

Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization.

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.\n  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations.

When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences.

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference.

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x."}

MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment.

In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels.

Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance.

In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines. Code will be released."}

To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure.

To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms. Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages. We evaluate our approach on various tasks like the SWAG, declension prediction for inflected languages, metaphor and chiasmus detection for various languages.

We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools."}

FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT.

SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models.

As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence."}

By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio."}

While recent work shows that large language models (LLMs) can generate forecasts competitive with human forecasters, it remains unclear how input context should be designed to support accurate prediction. In this paper, we study this question through experiments on earnings-call mention markets, which require forecasting whether a company will mention a specified keyword during its upcoming call. We run controlled comparisons varying (i) which contextual information is provided (news and/or prior earnings-call transcripts) and (ii) how \\textit{market probability}, (i.e., prediction market contract price) is used. We introduce Market-Conditioned Prompting (MCP), which explicitly treats the market-implied probability as a prior and instructs the LLM to update this prior using textual evidence, rather than re-predicting the base rate from scratch. In our experiments, we find three insights: (1) richer context consistently improves forecasting performance; (2) market-conditioned prompting (MCP), which treats the market probability as a prior and updates it using textual evidence, yields better-calibrated forecasts; and (3) a mixture of the market probability and MCP (MixMCP) outperforms the market baseline. By dampening the LLM's posterior update with the market prior, MixMCP yields more robust predictions than either the market or the LLM alone."}

Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost."}

Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch."}

To address this deficiency, we introduce TG-ASR for Taiwanese Hokkien drama speech recognition, a translation-guided ASR framework that utilizes multilingual translation embeddings to enhance recognition performance in low-resource environments. The framework is centered around the parallel gated cross-attention (PGCA) mechanism, which adaptively integrates embeddings from various auxiliary languages into the ASR decoder.

Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.\n  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding. Experiments on the publicly available highD dataset show that cVMDx achieves higher accuracy and significantly improved efficiency over cVMD, enabling fully stochastic, multimodal trajectory prediction."}

Extending coherent diffractive imaging to overlap-free operation on extended samples remains an open problem. Here, we extend PtychoPINN (O. Hoidn \\emph{et al.}, \\emph{Scientific Reports} \\textbf{13}, 22789, 2023) to deliver \\emph{overlap-free, single-shot} reconstructions in a Fresnel coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) geometry while also accelerating conventional multi-shot ptychography. The framework couples a differentiable forward model of coherent scattering with a Poisson photon-counting likelihood; real-space overlap enters as a tunable parameter via coordinate-based grouping rather than a hard requirement. On synthetic benchmarks, reconstructions remain accurate at low counts ($\\sim\\!10^4$ photons/frame), and overlap-free single-shot reconstruction with an experimental probe reaches amplitude structural similarity (SSIM) 0.904, compared with 0.968 for overlap-constrained reconstruction. Against a data-saturated supervised model with the same backbone (16,384 training images), PtychoPINN achieves higher SSIM with only 1,024 images and generalizes to unseen illumination profiles. Per-graphics processing unit (GPU) throughput is approximately $40\\times$ that of least-squares maximum-likelihood (LSQ-ML) reconstruction at matched $128\\times128$ resolution. These results, validated on experimental data from the Advanced Photon Source and the Linac Coherent Light Source, unify single-exposure Fresnel CDI and overlapped ptychography within one framework, supporting dose-efficient, high-throughput imaging at modern light sources."}

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality."}

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%. Project page: https://yy-gx.github.io/LiLo-VLA/."}

However, the fixed difficulty distribution of datasets limits the performance ceiling of the trained control policies. Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\\% compared to the baseline. Finally, we conduct comprehensive ablation and comparative experiments to highlight the rationality and advantages of our framework."}

Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that Dream-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy, mapping quality, and exploration efficiency.

To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.
